# Hello! 👋️
![](https://fb.com/xgnuhdev)

I am a software engineer from Viet Nam. My deal is building fast, beautiful and high-quality web apps, but I have also worked on mobile and desktop apps (it was pretty fun!). Whenever possible, I work with Open Source Software (OSS). You can check out my OSS projects here on GitHub.

Also, feel free to check what I've been rambling about on <a href="#" target="_blank">my blog</a>.
